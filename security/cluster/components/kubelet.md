# Securing kubelet 

## Breach 1: bypass admission controller 

```
If a static Pod fails admission control, the kubelet won't register the
Pod with the API server. However, the Pod still runs on the node. 
```

### Mitigate breach: Disable the directory for static pods on worker-nodes 

  * https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/api-server-bypass-risks/#static-pods-mitigations

```
# change the setting kubelef-config
staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
# -> to
staticPodPath: 
```

```
after that:

## Breach 2: Allowing anonymous access to kubelet 


### Disabling it in anycase 

  * in the newer of kubeadm it is already the case
  * Check with provider / installer 

```
 authentication:
      anonymous:
        enabled: false

```
